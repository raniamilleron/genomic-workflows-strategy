# Genomic Workflows: From Bash to Nextflow

## Overview

This project demonstrates how foundational tools like Bash and Nextflow can be used to structure, automate, and interpret simple genomic workflows. While not intended as production-ready pipelines, these scripts reflect a growing understanding of how sequence data is processed and how that process can inform scientific communication, evidence generation, and decision-making in Medical and Scientific Affairs.

## Context & Strategic Relevance

As genomic data becomes increasingly central to diagnostics and public health, understanding how data flows from raw sequence to actionable insight is essential. This project shows my ability to follow that process, evaluate workflow choices, and collaborate meaningfully with informatics and laboratory teams. 

It also reflects the value of knowing when lightweight tools (like Bash) are appropriate, and when scalable, reproducible systems (like Nextflow) are needed to support real-world applications.

## What This Demonstrates

- Familiarity with data handling concepts used in sequencing workflows
- Ability to create and run Bash and Nextflow pipelines for illustrative use cases
- Strategic understanding of how genomic pipelines support scientific evidence, quality control, and regulatory conversations
- Skills in cross-functional collaboration and scientific interpretation
