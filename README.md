# Genomic Workflows: From Bash to Nextflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates how foundational tools like **Bash** and **Nextflow** can be used to structure, automate, and interpret genomic workflows.

## Context & Strategic Relevance
As genomic data becomes increasingly central to diagnostics and public health, understanding how data flows from raw sequencing reads to interpretable results is essential.  
This repository reflects:
- When lightweight tools like Bash are appropriate
- When scalable, reproducible solutions like Nextflow are needed

## What This Demonstrates
- Familiarity with data handling concepts used in sequencing workflows  
- Ability to create and run Bash and Nextflow pipelines for illustrative use cases  
- Strategic understanding of how genomic pipelines support scientific evidence, quality control, and regulatory conversations  
- Skills in cross-functional collaboration and scientific interpretation  

## Files
- `bash_pipeline.sh` – Simple Bash script simulating a data-cleaning workflow  
- `main.nf` – A minimal Nextflow script illustrating automation and reproducibility  
- `README.md` – This file  

## Tools Used
- **Bash**
- **Nextflow**
- **Command-line environment** (Ubuntu via WSL)
